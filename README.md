# Conjugator: Your Japanese conjugations lookup tool
Conjugator is a lookup tool for Japanese conjugations (verbs, i-adjectives, na-adjectives). Japanese learners often struggle with the change of forms in conjugations. This app aims to provide a mobile-friendly way to search the other forms with a keyword.

This app does the job best when you enter a complete form of a conjugation, in its written form or just hiragana. For example, "来て" leads to the listing of "来る". When multiple words match, a list will be shown for you to select. For example, "きて" leads to both "来て" and "着て". Optionally, you can choose to show accents. It benefits learners by visualizing the pronounciation.

While this app might look like a full-fledged dictionary, it does not do a couple of things.
- It includes about 3500 conjugations, but not other parts of speech.
- It does not show the meaning of a word.
- It is text-only. It does not read out the word for you.
- It does not lookup from the web. All data is kept local.

This app is developed by an individual as a technical showcase and contribution to others. The word list is scraped from OJAD - Online Japanese Accent Dictionary with notice. Credit goes to their team. The database file is located at /app/main/assets/conjugator.db.
